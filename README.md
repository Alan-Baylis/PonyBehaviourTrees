PonyBehaviourTrees (PBT)
========================

PBT is a set of libraries to create and execute powerful artificial intelligences for games.
It is based on the idea behind "Behaviour Trees" while also offering C# scripting inside tree nodes.
It comes with an easy to use editor library to play with and develop your behaviour trees while your game is running.
