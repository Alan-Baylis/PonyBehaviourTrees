PonyBehaviourTrees (PBT)
========================

PBT is a set of libraries to create and execute powerful artificial intelligences for games.
It is based on the idea behind "Behaviour Trees" while also offering C# scripting inside tree nodes.
It comes with an easy to use editor library to play with and develop your behaviour trees while your game is running
and an inspection library to see what's going on in your AI while it is executed.
